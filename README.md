# Create Run Buddy page

* First, write the anchor tag and heading RUN BUDDY in the herader h1.

* Inside, I write tags like navigation/ unordered list/ list/ anchor and what we do/ what you do/ meet the trainers and reach out.

* Yes, this time I will add five sections inside.

* Those sections are hero/jumbotron, what we do, what you do, meet the trainers and reach out.

* Finally, write the footer section.

* I wrote made with love by Run Buddy and h2 tag inside.

* In the div tag, I wrote the anchor element and read our privacy policy.

Thank you.
